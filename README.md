# JComplier

This is a small compiler that will transform code written in a new stack oriented language, called J, into LC4 assembly code. 

When provided with a properly formatted source file in the J language it will produce the corresponding assembly code.  
That is calling   >>./jc foo.j   will produce a new file called   foo.asm   if foo.j contains an acceptable program otherwise it will print out helpful error messages.
